# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository only accepts reports related to code or product functionality.

Security reports are limited to vulnerabilities in the code of this project itself.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please open a [bug report](../../issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) using the standard bug report template.

Label the issue clearly so it can be identified as security-related.

**Do not** open issues to report:
- Interpersonal or conduct matters
- Third-party service vulnerabilities
- Spam or unrelated requests

## Response Expectations

This is a small personal project with limited maintainer capacity. Security reports will be reviewed, but response times cannot be guaranteed. Issues may be closed without response if they are out of scope.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of the project on the `main` branch is maintained.
