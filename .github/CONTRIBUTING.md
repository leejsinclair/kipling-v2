# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

This is a small personal project, so contributions are welcome but curated to keep scope focused.

Maintenance mode: this project has limited maintainer capacity, so issue and pull request responses may be delayed or unavailable.

## Ways to Contribute

- Report bugs using the bug report template.
- Suggest enhancements using the feature request template.
- Improve docs, tests, and code quality.

Only code and functional product issues are in scope for issue reporting in this repository.

## Before You Start

- Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicates.
- Open an issue for significant changes before implementing.

## Local Setup

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Install dependencies:
   - `npm install`
3. Run the app:
   - `npm run dev`

## Quality Checks

Please make sure these pass before opening a PR:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test -- --run`
- `npm run build`

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and small when possible.
- Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions.
- Include tests for behavior changes.
- Update docs when behavior or usage changes.

## Review Expectations

- Maintainer feedback may request scope reduction or follow-up issues.
- Not all contributions can be merged, even if technically correct.
- Respectful collaboration is expected in all reviews.

## Out of Scope

- Interpersonal or moderation reports
- Conduct enforcement requests
- Non-code operational requests

Out-of-scope issues may be closed without response.
